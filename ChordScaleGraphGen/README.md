**ChordScaleGraphGen.py**
*   Uses ChordScale to generate classes of chord scales
*   Graph/networks then defined
*   These graphs then used to generate random sequence of midi chords, bass note,
*   and melody with changing key
*   Graph dictionaries can be edited to shape sequence generation (the main point)
*   NB: Many issues/to dos eg only plays at 60bpm, chd needs to be changed when melnote played in different key, intkey to be included,  proper packaging etc
*   An initial proof of concept and learning project
*   .py has midi channel configuration to work with LMMS file included in this folder- LLMSForTest3
