# ChordScale.py
-python program for music creation 
-facillitate a user unaware of music theory to make music of coherent harmonic complexity
-generates ChordScales as class ojects (families of scales and chords) 
-chords and scales (attributes) confined to one octave to facillitate voice leading, minimal large intervallic leaps
-maps these dynamically to qwerty keyboard
-[a-g,z-n] select key/root note (ie c,c#,d,d# -> b)
-[1-7] play chords of that key from degree 1-7 (one octave, various inversions, plus bass note)
-[r-p] play melodic scale note (one octave)
-Intkey defines intervallic structure of scale (eg T=2 semitones, S=1 semitone, major scale=[T,T,S,T,T,T]=[2,2,1,2,2,2])
-proof of concept in python, limitation of latency won't be overcome until implemented in compiled language eg C
